        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My first internship was at a consulting company in Gothenburg called Nejla AB for a client, <a
                href="https://sambruk.se/om-sambruk/">Sambruk</a>.
            I worked with company's owner, as well as three more frontend developers also interns.
            The purpose of my 8-week internship was to contribute in redesigning the frontend of an existing system
            used by different communities in Sweden in their work with young people. The system has been used for some
            years now
            but the intention with this project was to use a different technology for the frontend and make the design
            more user-friendly
            and in accorndance with UX guidelines for accessibility. You can find some more information
            about the project in Swedish <a href="https://sambruk.se/projektet-som-ledde-fram-till-uka/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Requirements for this projects were mostly set by the client and the end users,
            i.e. administrative staff in communities that use the system.
        </p>
        <p>Basic requirements for the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep functionality with which staff is familiar and that works well</li>
            <li>Identify functionality that can be improved in the current system</li>
            <li>Add new functions and design features</li>
            <li>User friendly design</li>
            <li>Accessibility</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Personal contribution</h2>
        <p>For this project, I worked with <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>Boostrap-Vue</strong>
            for frontend development. I created two components, one of which was a modal (popup dialogue).
            This was also a type of form, thus would need validating which was done with
            <strong>Vee-Validate</strong>, a validation library that works great with Vue. The second component
            was a whole page that needed redesign, where staff can see information about the young people in the
            community and
            export it to SCB (Statistiska centralbyr√•n). I first redesigned it to have collapsible areas, making it
            possible
            to only view relevant information instead of everything at the same time. I also applied the design
            principles the group had agreed on in order to provide an accessible and user-friendly experience.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, I worked towards the <strong>DRY</strong> (don't repeat yourself) principle as much as I could.
            Not only did I do that in the code I wrote, but I also adjusted existing Vue components or
            JavaScript files (mixins) to write more efficient, non-repetitive code and help my team.
        </p>
        <p>Before starting with a new component, a UI design was made with <strong>Figma</strong> to guide the frontend
            design.
            I also used this design in order to explain to my colleagues the changes or additions I
            would make to agree on these before coding.</p>
        <p>Last, the team worked with <strong>agile methods</strong> as we would have standup meetings
            2-3 times per week to discuss our progress and if we needed help or we had some other problem.
            It also meant taking over tasks that felt interesting, relevant and within my area of expertise
            but at the same time learning a lot from my colleagues.</p>
        <h2>Demo</h2>
        <p>As material and code for this project is confidential, unfortunately I can't provide
            links to finished material or code for the project. I can, however, show you a demo of
            the components I have worked with in an eventual video call or provide you references from
            the company's owner who was also my mentor.
        </p>
