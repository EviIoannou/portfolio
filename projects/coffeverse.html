        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>"Coffeeverse" was my final project in my studies for Frontend developer at IT-HÃ¶gskolan
            in order to get my degree. It is a web app where one goes to order coffee
            and other snacks for "fika" and can choose among different coffee shops in their city.
            It was an idea I have had for a long time so that was the perfect instance to implement it!
        </p>
        <p>My work consisted of five phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>User research</li>
            <li>Analysis of requirements</li>
            <li>Information architecture</li>
            <li>UI design</li>
            <li>Frontend development</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>User research</h2>
        <p>First, I conducted research with some users to determine the relevance of the web application as well as most
            important
            features. The first part was an anonymous questionnaire, but with the choice to leave some contact details.
            The second part
            was in-depth interviews with two of the responders who were willing to be contacted and talk about their
            responses. </p>
        <p>I analysed the data to create two personas and a user journey (<a
                href="https://www.figma.com/file/yeDlzeM92WoCmzPrGIhzxK/Coffee-app-UX?type=design&node-id=1%3A8&mode=design&t=JWrrETJJL8khHwA3-1">personas
                and user flow</a>) to guide me in my design and coding.
            If you are interested, you can take a look at my data analysis in <a
                href="https://www.figma.com/file/yeDlzeM92WoCmzPrGIhzxK/Coffee-app-UX?type=design&node-id=1%3A8&mode=design&t=JWrrETJJL8khHwA3-1">UX
                research analysis</a>, in the section "Results".</p>
        <h2>Analysis of requirements</h2>
        <p>First, I conducted reasearch with some users in order to determine the relevance of the web app
            as well as most important features. Research was conducted first with a questionnaire and then with two
            more in-depth interviews.
        </p>
        <p>The most important requirements were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A variety of drinks and snacks to choose from</li>
            <li>A variety of coffee shops</li>
            <li>Filtering and sorting functions for a user-friendly website</li>
            <li>See product ratings</li>
            <li>Visible product prices and offers/ discounts</li>
            <li>User is able to review their order status: Time left to delivery, items in order</li>
            <li>Complete order by entering delivery info and paying (not real payment)</li>
            <li>Two options for payment: credit card or swish</li>
            <li>Feedback to user when order is placed successfully </li>
            <li>User friendly design according to UX guidelines</li>
            <li>Responsive website adjusted to mobile and tablet screens</li>
            <li>App in English</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Information architecture</h2>
        <p>Following user research and documentation of requirements, I created diagrams for the database structure and
            for the flow of
            the website's basic functions. For example:</p>
        <img src="../images/database.png" alt="database">
        <h2>UI design</h2>
        <p>For my UI design, I started with a moodboard where I gathered design ideas for my website. I then created
            different colour
            palettes and font styles that I could use, always keeping in mind the rules for accessibility. As this
            project was completed
            in a limited time, I did not conduct extensive user testing and iterations for my design. However, I tried
            to get users'
            feedback whenever possible.</p>
        <p>In order to create the lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes before programming, I used <strong>Figma</strong>. Images
            were first edited with <strong>GIMP</strong> to remove unnecessary background and to fix dimensions. The
            final versions of
            the images used in the website were created with Figma to add the brand icon.
        </p>
        <h2>Frontend development</h2>
        <p><strong>Firebase Firestore</strong> was used for storing data about the products in the "Coffeeverse" and
            fetching them via API in my Vue application.
            It was also used to store all the images, as this minimized the storage my app was going to occupy.</p>
        <p>Frontend development of the web app was done with <strong>Vue js</strong> and <strong>Boostrap-Vue</strong>.
            Focus was on organizing the Vue components in an efficient way, applying the DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
            principle
            and translating the UI design to code, in order to deliver the best experience to the user.</p>
