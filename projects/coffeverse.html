        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>"Coffeeverse" was my final project in my studies for Frontend developer at IT-HÃ¶gskolan 
            in order to get my degree. It is a web app where one goes to order coffee 
            and other snacks for "fika" and can choose among different coffee shops in their city.
            Right now it is functioning in a basic, demonstrative level and the user cannot place 
            an actual order, but rather a fictional one. 
            It was an idea I have had for a long time so that was the perfect instance to implement it!
        </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>First, I conducted reasearch with some users in order to determine the relevance of the web app 
            as well as most important features. Research was conducted first with a questionnaire and then with two
            more in-depth interviews. 
        </p>
        <p>Basic requirements for the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A variety of drinks and snacks to choose from</li>
            <li>A variety of coffee shops</li>
            <li>Filtering and sorting functions for a user-friendly website</li>
            <li>See product ratings</li>
            <li>Visible product prices and offers/ discounts</li>
            <li>User is able to review their order status: Time left to delivery, items in order</li>
            <li>Complete order by entering delivery info and paying (not real payment)</li>
            <li>Two options for payment: credit card or swish</li>
            <li>Feedback to user when order is placed successfully </li>  
            <li>User friendly design according to UX guidelines</li>
            <li>Responsive website adjusted to mobile and tablet screens</li>
            <li>App in English</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the project was realized within three weeks, some of the basic requirements were not fulfilled.
            Functions that were important for the website to work were prioritized over enhancement features, but
            it is definitely a work in progress that will be much improved in the future.
        </p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>In order to create the lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes before programming, I used <strong>Figma</strong> . Images were first edited with <strong>GIMP</strong> 
            to remove unnecessary background and to fix dimensions. The final versions of the images used in the website
            were created with Figma in order to add the brand icon.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Firebase Firestore</strong> was used for storing data about the products in the "Coffeeverse" and fetching them via API in my Vue application. 
        It was also used to store all the images, as this minimized the storage my app was going to occupy</p>
        <p>Frontend development of the web app was done with <strong>Vue js</strong> and <strong>Boostrap-Vue</strong>. 
            Focus was on organizing the Vue components in an efficient way, applying the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle
            and translating the UI design to code, in order to deliver the best experience to the user.</p>
