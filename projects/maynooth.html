        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My second internship was at a company in Stockholm called <a href="https://www.charpstar.se/">CharpstAR</a> where 
            I collaborated with one more frontend developer who was also an intern. The purpose 
            of my 16-week internship was to contribute in creating the frontend for a new platform
            which will be used by the company for the management of 3D assets. This platform will be used
            by emplyees with various roles like admin, Quality Assurance team and 3D artists, and of course
            by clients. The backend was created by a team before us, together with a preliminary 
            frontend design which needed to be redesigned.

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Requirements for this projects were established by the company's CEO and CTO, as well as by users after testing and receiving feedback.
        <p>Basic requirements for the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate the company's graphic profile in the design</li>
            <li>User-friendly and easy to use interface</li>
            <li>Create new or change existing components to achieve the previous requirement</li>
            <li>Identify issues in the code and fix if possible</li>
            <li>Regularly update platform online on Digital Ocean</li>
            <li>Document all changes and decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Project details</h2>
        <p>For this project I mainly worked with <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>Vuetify</strong>.
            Basically I needed to translate the UI design from Figma, created by my colleague, to code. 
            However, I had to make decisions when an element was not possible to create in the code 
            or could be made different for better result. Such changes were communicated to the rest of the
            group before being realized.
        </p>
        <p> One of my main tasks was to create a new bar graph to display data dynamically. After comparing
            a few relevant JavaScript libraries that can be used with Vue, I decided to use <strong>Vue-chart js</strong>.
            I was then able to create a bar graph that displays dynamic data and to even display icons
            instead of text as labels. These icons were created with <strong>Figma</strong>.
            Hovering over the bars also gives additional information about each product. 
            An example of such a bar graph:

        </p>
        <p>Throughout my 16 weeks in the project, I also created new Vue components to achieve the desired design,
            I identified and fixed as many issues as possible in the frontend and regularly updated the platform on
            <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Me and my colleague used Trello for working in a KANBAN type of board, with labels, descriptions and images.
            Each of us would take over tasks that felt most relevant to our expertise or most interesting to work with.
            Once a week for about 9 weeks we would have a meeting with all parts involved in the project, that is 
            users, CEO and CTO, to communicate our progress and discuss feedback.
