        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The "Hamsterwars" game was the final project in a course on React I took as part of my studies.
            The inspiration was a game called <a href="http://www.kittenwar.com/">"kittenwar"</a> but instead I needed
            to
            make a similar one with hamster contestants. The main idea is simply to pick the cutest hamster to win!
        </p>
        <img src="../images/hamsterwars-screenshot.png" alt="hamsters-battle">
        <p>This was a fullstack project that involved working with databases and backend as well as on the Frontend with
            React.
            Focus was on functionality rather than the UI design within the time that was provided to complete the
            project
            (about three weeks).
        </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Requirements for this projects were set by the course plan and the teacher.
        </p>
        <p>Basic requirements for the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store data about the different contsestans on Firebase</li>
            <li>User can add new contestants via a form, i.e. add data in the database</li>
            <li>User can choose contestants to compete by choosing their name or getting a random hamster</li>
            <li>See data on previous games, i.e. winner and loser</li>
            <li>See ranking of hamsters, top 5 and bottom 5</li>
            <li>User friendly design</li>
            <li>Website has to be developed with React</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Firebase Firestore</strong> was used for storing data about the contestants.
            The project involved fetching this data as well as updating it, deleting it and adding new data via API.
            Therefore, a server(backend) folder was created to include all files that were related to Firebase
            or that included the routes with <strong>Express</strong>.</p>
        <p>Before beginning programming of the frontend, a UI design was made with <strong>Figma</strong> to guide the
            frontend design.</p>
        <p>Frontend development of the web app was done with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.
            Focus was on achieving the desired functionality with the React framework and to use its components in an
            efficient way. It was
            a learning process for me as I hadn't used React before and I initially found it less intuitive than Vue.js.
            The design only works well on
            desktop in this case, and needs more work in order to be responsive to smaller screens.</p>
